QUESTIONS

DESIGN
    You have 5 units. (you included) And you're trying to get them from Mexico to USA. There are two maps. The International map where you're trying to avoid hot spots and make progress. And a local map where you're near Border Patrol and trying to escape being seen.

    What if for the international map, it was like a Minesweeper-esque style map? And then local map is more like X-Com?

    Cover page maybe...the abstract colors of a Mexican flag / somehow intertwined with American flag with El Coyote written over it.

    
MAYBE
    turn pig's vision into american flag
    what if in the world map, maybe you could see which direction the pigs are looking, so there's more than just the mine space to avoid?
